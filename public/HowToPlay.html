            At the start of the game you will have to place a variety of boats, of different sizes, on your field. 
            The boats can't overlap or go outside of the field. You will have to place your boats in such a way that your enemy won't guess where they are placed.
            
            Your turn: You have to choose a square on the field of your enemy to fire at. You will then see if it is a hit or miss. If you hit, you are allowed to fire again.
            If you miss, your turn will end.

            Enemy turn: Your enemy will choose a square on your field, to try and hit one of your boats. If the enemy hits one of your boats, they are allowed to fire again.
            If they miss, it is your turn.
